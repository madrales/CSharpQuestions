**Q: What is a namespace?**

A namespace is an vital part to a C# program that refers to the collection of classes in a program. An example namespace could be named "CSharp" and contain the class "Program".

**Q: What are value types?**

Value types are variables that store an actual value inside of them. This could be an int, double, char, etc.
**Q: What are reference types?**

Reference types refer to a stored value rather than holding a value inside of its self. This could be an object, string, etc.

**Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?**

An automatic property is a property that is built in to the C# compiler (Visual Studios). This is most commonly seen in get and set methods and is type safe while leading to faster and shorter code.

**Q: What is the purpose of using statement?**

The using statement must be used to declare which namespace is going to be used for the program.

**Q: What are dynamic type variables?**

Dynamic types can be assigned as any type of value and is compiled at runtime unlike the object class. Value types, reference types, int, etc.

**Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?**

The is operator determines if an object is of a certain type. This could be used to check if Car is an int, string, object, etc.

**Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?**

Generics are ways to simplify code reuse, type safety, and to increase performance of the program. It is a class that allows the user to use methods or interfaces as a parameter.

**Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?**

The scope is open to any other class in the program. Public allows a member to be accessed throughout the program.

**Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?**

Yes, the keyword *params* allow the user to define a varying number of arguments in a list when they declare the function

**Q: How do you sort an array?**

Using the ArrayName.Sort method, the user can sort an array by value.

**Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?**

Nullable types allow the user to set a variable to a null value as well as a normal positive or negative value. This would be helpful with databases that contains null values and not just True/False.

**Q: What is an enumeration?**

It is a type of reference that allows the user to set specific values as named constants. An example would be an enum Gender that contains Male or Female.

**Q: What is inheritance?**

Inheritance is where a class can inherit properties, fields, and attributes from a base class or parent class.

**Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?**

Multiple inheritance is not supported, but is also not impossible. There are ways to get around this.

**Q: What is the purpose of as operator**

The *as* operator servers to set compatible value types as one another. This casting raises a null value instead of an exception when the values are not compatible.

**Q: What is an object?**

It is able to hold any value, reference, or dynamic type. It is instantiated from a class.

**Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?**

Structs are value types and classes are reference types. Classes refer to the methods and fields that are referring to past code. Structs hold the value of whatever they initialize and then hold that value rather than referring to it.

**Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?**

Continue statements allow the loop or program to continue running and to go through later steps again. Break statments end the loop and leave to the scope of the project outside of the loop.

**Q: What is this and how is it used?**

It refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to instantiate objects from a class with same traits as to not confuse the user or the program.

**Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?**

Try and catch are used to handle exceptions. Try attempts to do the code inside of the brackets while the catch catches an error that the developer handles.

**Q: How is exception handling done?**

Try and Catch statements are a really big part of the exception handling process. The two methods makes sure that the program attempts to execute code and finds and exceptions to that attempt.

**Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?**

Finally proposes what the program should do after trying and catching exceptions. The program will execute the finally statement once all try blocks have been executed and after all exceptions are raised.

**Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.**

The difference between an Array and an ArrayList is the level of flexibility of each type. An array must define how many elements it is going to hold when it is created and can not add elements later on in the code. This is similar to a tuple in python as they are immutable. An ArrayList can add or remove elements in itself throughout the code and does not have to be defined upon creation. An ArrayList is similar to a list in python as it is mutable and can be changed.

**Q: What is an object?**

It is able to hold any value, reference, or dynamic type. It is instantiated from a class.

**Q: Define constructor.**

Special method of the class that contains the set of instructions for an object when it is created. 

**Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?**

Var can be used when the program can implicitly write out a variable and decide what kind of value type to assign to it. It must be a type the program knows in a limited scope.

**Q: What is an abstract class?**

It is used to define a base class in a program. Using abstraction, the base class is just referred to without explaining what it does in total.

**Q: What is an interface?**

It tells the classes that derive from it what to do. Those classes then determine how they need to do it.

**Q: What is a method?**

A group of statements that accomplish a task. This is shown when a method makes an object print out a statement.

**Q: What is a property?**

Get and Set are both properties. They provide a felxible way or reading, writing, or changing files in the program.

**Q: What is an access specifier?**

Keywords that specify what level of access the variable can be seen/reached from. 

**Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?**

  Private: scope is only in the specific use it is defined in
  Public: scope is the whole program
  Protected: used for inheritance, keeps the attributes of the parent class protected from the child class
  Internal: scope expands across all classes, makes them accessible in assembly.

**Q: What is a collection?**

It is a flexible way to store variables that can be taken out or put into the collection. This includes Queues, Stacks, Arraylists and others.

**Q: What is a Hash Table?**

A collection of key and value pairs. They are used when you have a specific key.
